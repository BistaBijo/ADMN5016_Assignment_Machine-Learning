  <b>Project Proposal</b>
  
Shopping cart abandonment occurs when a potential buyer begins the online check out process but leaves the page before making a purchase. Any item that is added to the shopping cart but never purchased is regarded as having been "abandoned" by the customer. Retailers pay close attention to the crucial part of the online purchasing process known as cart abandonment. We have made the decision to forecast if the customer will abandon the order or not. By doing this, specific measures can be done to lower the rate of cart abandonment, improving profit. For the AI application, we are planning to use Sci-kit learn package for data modelling.

<b>About the dataset</b>

For this project, we used a dataset from GitHub. This dataset contains 4284 rows and 13 columns. The input variables are:

ID: The session id of the customer.

Is_Product_Details_viewed: Whether the customer is viewing the product details or not.

Session_Activity_Count: How many times a customer is going to the different pages.

No_Items_Added_InCart: Number of items in cart.

No_Items_Removed_FromCart: Number of items removed from the cart.

No_Cart_Viewed: How many times the customer is going to the cart page.

No_Checkout_Confirmed: How many times the checkout has been confirmed successfully by the customer.

No_Checkout_Initiated: How many times the checkout(successful as well as unsuccess) is being done by the user.

No_Cart_Items_Viewed: How many times a user is viewing the product from cart.

No_Customer_Login: Number of times the customer had did log in.

No_Page_Viewed: Number of pages viewed by the customer. Customer_Segment_Type: The customer falls under which category,i.e, 0 for Target Customer, 1 for Loyal Customer, and 2 for Untargeted customer.

Cart_Abandoned: Whether the customer is doing cart abandonment or not. This is the target variable that we need to predict.
